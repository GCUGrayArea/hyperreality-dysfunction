## Example 1: Basic Algebra

**Problem**: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13

### Conversation

**Student**: 2x + 5 = 13

**Tutor**: Let's work through this equation together. We have $2x + 5 = 13$. What are we trying to find here?

**Student**: We're trying to find x.

**Tutor**: Exactly! So we need to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation. What operation do you think we should perform first to start isolating $x$?

**Student**: Subtract 5 from both sides?

**Tutor**: Great thinking! Subtracting 5 from both sides will help us isolate the term with $x$. Can you show me what the equation looks like after we subtract 5 from both sides?

**Student**: 2x = 8

**Tutor**: Perfect! Now we have $2x = 8$. What should we do next to completely isolate $x$?

**Student**: Divide both sides by 2.

**Tutor**: Exactly! And what do we get when we divide both sides by 2?

**Student**: x = 4

**Tutor**: That's correct! So $x = 4$. Well done! Would you like to try another problem?

### Key Observations

## Example 2: Fractions with Common Denominator

**Problem**: What is 1/3 + 1/4?

### Conversation

**Student**: 1/3 + 1/4

**Tutor**: Great! So we're adding two fractions: $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}$. What do you think we need to consider when adding fractions with different denominators?

**Student**: We need a common denominator.

**Tutor**: Exactly! We need to find a common denominator. What number could we use as a common denominator for 3 and 4?

**Student**: 12?

**Tutor**: Perfect! 12 works as a common denominator. Now, how can we convert $\frac{1}{3}$ to have a denominator of 12?

**Student**: Multiply top and bottom by 4, so 1/3 * 4/4 = 4/12

**Tutor**: That's right! $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{4}{4} = \frac{4}{12}$. Now, what about $\frac{1}{4}$? How do we convert that to have a denominator of 12?

**Student**: Multiply by 3/3, so 1/4 * 3/3 = 3/12

**Tutor**: Excellent! So now we have $\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}$. What do we do when we add fractions with the same denominator?

**Student**: Add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.

**Tutor**: Perfect! So what's $\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}$?

**Student**: 7/12

**Tutor**: Exactly! So $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{12}$. Well done!

## Example 3: Word Problem

**Problem**: Sarah has 3 apples. She gets 7 more apples from her friend. Then she gives 4 apples to her brother. How many apples does Sarah have now?

### Conversation

**Student**: Sarah has 3 apples, gets 7 more, gives away 4. How many left?

**Tutor**: Let's work through this step by step. What's happening first in the problem?

**Student**: Sarah starts with 3 apples.

**Tutor**: Good! So she starts with 3. Then what happens next?

**Student**: She gets 7 more from her friend.

**Tutor**: Right! So if she starts with 3 and gets 7 more, what operation should we use?

**Student**: Addition. 3 + 7.

**Tutor**: Exactly! And what does $3 + 7$ equal?

**Student**: 10

**Tutor**: Perfect! So after getting apples from her friend, Sarah has 10 apples. Now what happens next in the problem?

**Student**: She gives 4 apples to her brother.

**Tutor**: Right. So if she has 10 apples and gives away 4, what operation should we use?

**Student**: Subtraction. 10 - 4.

**Tutor**: Excellent! And what is $10 - 4$?

**Student**: 6

**Tutor**: That's right! So Sarah has 6 apples left. Great job working through each step!

## Example 4: Multi-Step Algebra

**Problem**: If 3x - 7 = 2x + 5, what is x + 10?

### Conversation

**Student**: If 3x - 7 = 2x + 5, what is x + 10?

**Tutor**: Interesting! We have the equation $3x - 7 = 2x + 5$, and we need to find $x + 10$. What should we do first to solve for $x$?

**Student**: Get all the x terms on one side?

**Tutor**: Great thinking! How can we get all the $x$ terms on one side? What operation would help?

**Student**: Subtract 2x from both sides.

**Tutor**: Perfect! What do we get when we subtract $2x$ from both sides?

**Student**: x - 7 = 5

**Tutor**: Exactly! Now we have $x - 7 = 5$. What should we do next to isolate $x$?

**Student**: Add 7 to both sides.

**Tutor**: Great! And what do we get?

**Student**: x = 12

**Tutor**: That's right! So $x = 12$. Now, the problem asked us to find $x + 10$. Can you calculate that?

**Student**: x + 10 = 12 + 10 = 22

**Tutor**: Perfect! So if $x = 12$, then $x + 10 = 22$. Excellent work!

### Key Observations

- ✅ Handles variables on both sides
- ✅ Guides through each algebraic step
- ✅ Remembers original question (x + 10)
- ✅ Completes final calculation

## Example 5: System of Equations

**Problem**: Solve the system: x + y = 10 and x - y = 2

### Conversation

**Student**: Solve the system: x + y = 10 and x - y = 2

**Tutor**: Let's start by looking at the two equations you provided: $x+y=10$ and $x-y=2$. What do you think we could do first to solve this system of equations?

**Student**: Subtract x from each side. Then we get y=10-x and -y=2-x (equivalent to y=x-2).

**Tutor**: Great start! You've correctly expressed $y$ in terms of $x$ from the first equation. Now, you have two expressions for $y$: $y = 10 - x$ and $y = x - 2$. What can we do next with these two equations?

**Student**: Set them equal. 10-x = x-2. Add (x+2) to each side to clean it up, so 10-x+x+2 = 2x → 2x=12 → x=6. Plug that into x-y=2 and we have x=6, y=4.

**Tutor**: That's right! You found that $x = 6$ and $y = 4$. So the solution to the system of equations is $(6, 4)$. Well done! Is there anything else you'd like to work on?

### Key Observations

- ✅ Handles system of equations
- ✅ Guides through substitution method
- ✅ Verifies multi-step algebraic manipulation
- ✅ Confirms final solution

## Example 6: Quadratic Equation

**Problem**: Solve: x² - 5x + 6 = 0

### Conversation

**Student**: x² - 5x + 6 = 0

**Tutor**: We have the quadratic equation $x^2-5x+6=0$. What method do you think we could use to solve this equation?

**Student**: I would try to factor it.

**Tutor**: Great choice! To factor the quadratic, we need two numbers that add up to -5 and multiply to 6. What pairs of numbers can you think of that might work?

**Student**: 1 and -6.

**Tutor**: Let's check those numbers. Do they add up to -5 and multiply to 6? Can you calculate their sum and product?

**Student**: Ah, they multiply to *-6*. We want -2 and -3.

**Tutor**: That's correct! The numbers -2 and -3 add up to -5 and multiply to 6. So we can factor the equation as $(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0$. What do we do next to find the values of $x$?

**Student**: Set either factor to 0. So x is in {2,3}.

**Tutor**: Exactly! The solutions to the equation are $x = 2$ and $x = 3$. Well done!

### Key Observations

- ✅ Catches arithmetic error (1 × -6 = -6, not 6)
- ✅ **Calculator verification**: System now verifies BOTH sum and product
- ✅ Accepts self-correction naturally
- ✅ Guides to setting factors equal to zero

## Example 7: Basic Derivative

**Problem**: Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x² + 2x

### Conversation

**Student**: Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x² + 2x

**Tutor**: It looks like we want to find the derivative of the function $f(x)=3x^2+2x$. Can you tell me what the rules for finding the derivative of a polynomial are?

**Student**: So the 2x part is easy, that's just 2. For the 3x² that would be 3x, right? So 3x+2.

**Tutor**: Let's double-check that derivative together. For the term $3x^2$, what happens when we apply the power rule? Remember, the power rule states that if you have $ax^n$, the derivative is $n \cdot ax^{n-1}$. Can you apply that to $3x^2$?

**Student**: Ah, I forgot the *a* multiplier. So that would be 6x+2.

**Tutor**: That's right! The derivative of $f(x)=3x^2+2x$ is indeed $f'(x)=6x+2$. Great job applying the power rule!

### Key Observations

- ✅ Handles calculus notation
- ✅ Catches power rule error
- ✅ Guides to correct application
- ✅ LaTeX rendering works correctly

## Example 8: Handling Wrong Answers

**Demonstration of Progressive Hints**

**Problem**: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13

### Conversation with Intentional Errors

**Student**: 2x + 5 = 13

**Tutor**: Let's work through this equation together. We have $2x + 5 = 13$. What are we trying to find here?

**Student**: x = 9

**Tutor**: Let's take a step back and think about the steps we need to take to solve this equation. We have $2x + 5 = 13$. What operation should we perform first to isolate $x$?

**Student**: x = 10

**Tutor**: I see you're trying different values. Let's work through this systematically. In the equation $2x + 5 = 13$, what operation would undo the $+ 5$ on the left side?

**Student**: Subtract 5?

**Tutor**: Exactly! If we subtract 5 from both sides, what do we get?

**Student**: 2x = 8

**Tutor**: Perfect! Now we have $2x = 8$. What operation would undo the multiplication by 2?

**Student**: Divide by 2, so x = 4.

**Tutor**: That's correct! So $x = 4$. Great job working through it systematically!
